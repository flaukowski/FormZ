Peaceful form of competition

Even though I believe wrestling to be the most pure form of competition, the point has been diluted with rules.  Therefore, a new form which is much simpler and to the point must be created.

1.  The point is to score once.  There is only 1 chance
2.  Because there must be a physical space, utilize existing ring dimensions O
3.  Because we have limited time, matches will have an agreed upon time limit before ending in a draw
  ie One 22 minute period.  A break can be agreed upon. ie 2 minute break @ 11 minutes
4.  For action, arms to arms, legs to legs, thereby allowing a fusion of Greco, Sumo, Judo, Freestyle, etc
5.  No striking, no leg grabbing... this is about respect for the competition
6.  One warning before disqualification
7.  Evolve it and have fun!
